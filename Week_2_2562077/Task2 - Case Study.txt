*#* Case Study: Student Attendance System


### 1. Six phases of Waterfall Model applied to Student Attendance System

-> 1) Requirement Analysis

In this phase, all the requirements of the system are collected. The developers talk to the school staff to understand what they want from the system.

For this system, the school wants to record daily attendance, generate monthly attendance reports and send notifications to parents when a student is absent.



-> 2) System Design

In this phase, the overall design of the system is prepared. This includes database design, system structure and data flow.

For the attendance system, tables for students, attendance records and parents are designed. The way reports and notifications will work is also planned.



-> 3) Implementation

In this phase, actual coding of the system is done according to the design.

For this system, code is written to mark daily attendance, generate monthly reports and send absence notifications to parents.



-> 4) Testing

In the testing phase, the system is checked to find errors and bugs. It ensures that the system works properly.

Here, the attendance entries, monthly reports and notification feature are tested to make sure they work correctly.


-> 5) Deployment

In this phase, the system is installed and made available for real use.

The attendance system is deployed in the school so teachers and administration staff can start using it.


-> 6) Maintenance

Maintenance is done after deployment. Any problems or small changes are handled in this phase.

For this system, bugs in reports or notification issues are fixed if they occur.




### 2. One example task in each phase

| Phase                | Example Task                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Requirement Analysis | Collecting attendance requirements from school |
| System Design        | Designing student and attendance database      |
| Implementation       | Coding attendance entry module                 |
| Testing              | Testing monthly attendance report              |
| Deployment           | Installing system in school                    |
| Maintenance          | Fixing errors in notification system           |



### 3. Advantages and disadvantages of Waterfall Model

#*# Advantages:

1. It is easy to understand and manage.
2. It is suitable when requirements are clear and fixed.

#*# Disadvantages:

1. Changes are difficult after a phase is completed.
2. Working software is available only at the end of the project.



-> Conclusion

The Waterfall Model is suitable for the Student Attendance System because the requirements are clear and do not change frequently.
The step-by-step approach makes development systematic and organized.
